{"name":"Voxce","tagline":"Clinical Trial Framework Open Source","body":"### Welcome to VOXCE.\r\nVOXCE™ is the first open source clinical trial management framework and CTMS to offer truly complete control of data collection, operations and analysis, providing the ability to:\r\n* Manage patients from enrollment to withdraw\r\n* Conduct multicenter clinical trials and research projects from inception to market or bedside on a global scale\r\n* Manage data operations\r\n* Capture submission process to different submission organizations\r\n* Track multiple studies across sponsors and sites with diverse colleagues\r\n* Manage payments throughout a study\r\n* Track protocol changes\r\n* Manage different user groups\r\n* Create monitoring reports\r\n* Capture Adverse Events\r\n* Capture laboratories, laboratory data, drugs and which laboratories associated with sites and studies\r\n\r\nVOXCE is built using a subscription model allowing multiple users to be part of that subscription, which allows users to utilize the same libraries and templates, which utilizes questions, sections and forms. An organization can have multiple subscriptions, where each subscription group will have their own libraries, questions and more.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd trialmanager/voxce\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nVOXCE has been in development since 2009 by Wessam Sonbol @trialmanager (twitter @wsonbol). Over the years Wessam has developed multiple trial management solutions and in 2014 we realized that it is time to publish what we have done thus far.
