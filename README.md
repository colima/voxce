Clinical Trial Management Framework Open Source

The system is developed for scalability, standardization and flexibility. VOXCE is developed on a modular platform allowing for flexibility throughout the development process. 

Each one of the major tabs in the system is developed as its own module, which ensures that if an error occurs within one of the modules, it will not affect the flow of the system.

All relationships occur on the database level and through group rights.
